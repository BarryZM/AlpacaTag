# AlpacaTag
**_AlpacaTag is an active learning-based crowd annotation framework for sequence tagging, such as named-entity recognition (NER)._**


The UI framework is based on the awesome work of [Doccano](https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano), while the distinctive advantages of AlpacaTag are three-fold:

* **Active intelligent recommendation**: 
dynamically suggesting annotations and sampling the most informative unlabeled instances with a back-end active learned model.
* **Automatic crowd consolidation**: enhancing real-time inter-annotator agreement by merging inconsistent labels from multiple annotators.
* **Real-time model deployment**: users can deploy their models in downstream systems while new annotations are being made.
